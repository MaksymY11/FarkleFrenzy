## 📜 Rules of the Game
Players take turns rolling six dice, earning points based on specific combinations. After each roll, players must decide whether to **bank their score** or **risk rolling again**. If a player rolls and gets no valid scoring combination, they **Farkle** and lose all unbanked points for that turn.
